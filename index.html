          <h3> <a id="C1">1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</a> </h3>
          <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects and data. Python is an object-oriented programming language. </p>

          <h3><a id="C2">2. Class </a> </h3>
          <p>A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation. </p>
          <p> YOu can create a class by grouping a few related functions together.</p>
          <p> Class is like a blueprint.</p>

          <h3> <a id="C3">3. Object </a></h3>
          <p>A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.</p>
          <p> Object is like a specific building that is built from a blueprint.For example: Brad & Angie are objects of Class Turtle.</p>

          <h3><a id="C9">9. Module </a></h3>
          <p>A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference. </p>
          <p>A module can define functions, classes and variables. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. </p>
          <p>You can use any Python source file as a module by executing an import statement in some other Python source file.</p>

            <h3><a id="C10">10. Python Standard Library </a></h3>
            <p>Pythonâ€™s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized
              solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming.

            <h3><a id="C11">11. Why is <span class="bold">"OOP"</span> a valuable tool for thinking about large progarmming projects? </a> </h3>
            <p>Python classes are tools that programmers can create and reuse forever! Once you've created a class once, you never have to create it again. Classes group functions (in a class they are called methods) that belong together. This is sort of
              what modules do. However, classes have a leg up on modules, they have a way to inherit other classes and establish a tree search structure for attributes in any of these inherited/linked classes. You can go without classes and OOP, but the
              ease of reuse of existing code makes a difference as you write larger programs.</p>

            <h3><a id="C12">12. Method Overriding </a></h3>
            <p>Overriding is the ability of a class to change the implementation of a method provided by one of its ancestors.
              <br> Overriding is a very important part of OOP since it is the feature that makes inheritance exploit its full power. Through method overriding a class may "copy" another class, avoiding duplicated code, and at the same time enhance or customize
              part of it. Method overriding is thus a strict part of the inheritance mechanism.</p>

            <h3><a id="C13">13. Three Crucial questions we always need to ask before coding a new project.<a></h3>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>What is the input?</li>
                <li>What is our output?</li>
                <li>How are we going to get from input to output?</li>
            </p>
            <p>No matter what progamming language we use (HTML, CSS, Python, etc.), we always need to ask these three questions. These key questions will help us outline a plan to code any project.
              <br> Object-Oriented Programming is a useful way to organize information in a conceptual way.This new way to create a data structure allows us to represent our concept in an object giving us the freedom to manipulate our objects in a concise
              and efficient way.</p>
